# John Rosner's Chess Game

This was a project I worked on during Summer 2020.
This version of chess was built from scratch using JavaFX as a GUI library.
It features two player, single player, and AI vs AI (though AI vs AI doesn't always end in one of them winning)
The game of chess is fully featured (Except for En passant)
