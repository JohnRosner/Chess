Chess Game
This is where I am keeping track of the different things that need to be done to this project

TODO:
show history
Account for stalemate
Improve AI
Write tests


AI:
To improve alpha beta pruning, the moves must be roughly ordered so that more likely valuable moves occur first in the list
	This can be done within the getLegalMoves method
Another way to improve efficiency is to store where its pieces are instead of searching for them
